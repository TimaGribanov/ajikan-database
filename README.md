**NB!** Currently, it doesn't work since the back-end was hosted on Heroku and my account was suspended. If I get my account restored, then I'll restore it. Otherwise, I'll most likely drop it.

# Asian Kung-Fu Generation Database
This is a little project that allows anyone to get info about records that a certain song of a band Asian Kung-Fu Generation is on.

The project contains of back-end (PostgreSQL database and Node.js server) hosted on Heroku and front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript with alasql) hosted on GitHub Pages.

## For fans of the band
The list is not the fullest yet. As for now, I have added only studio albums, singles, indies, mini-albums and a couple of Ajikan-only compilations (_Feedback File_, _Feedback File 2_, _Best Hit AKG_, _Best Hit AKG 2_ and _The Recording at NHK_).
As for other records, I may add it later.
Moreover, I thought of making pages for each and every record and so on, but I'll think of it.

As for the names of songs, English names I took from Spotify, if there were no translated version, I did that myself.
